Redesign the current Dopaya "About Us" page to reflect our new structure and content. Therefore, please create a About us page (Variant 2) and add it to the nav bar.

// Use the same visual style as the current live page (see screenshots): clean typography, white or beige background, lightly bordered sections, SDG icons, orange accents.

// PAGE STRUCTURE & CONTENT

///////////////////////////////////////
// SECTION 1 – Name Meaning (Keep as-is)
///////////////////////////////////////

Keep the existing layout and content:
- Show: [du·pa·ya]
- Subtitle: Origin: Sanskrit & English, Meaning: Taking action toward real solutions
- Two definition cards:
  - DO: Action, making things happen.
  - UPAYA: A skillful means, an effective method, a path toward a goal.

///////////////////////////////////////
// SECTION 2 – The Problem / Why We Exist
///////////////////////////////////////

Headline: “Why Another Impact Platform?”

Paragraph:
"Despite billions in giving, change still feels too slow. Funding gets lost, impact remains invisible, and those doing the work — social enterprises — often go unseen. We believe in a better way — one that’s transparent, rewarding, and built around people-powered solutions."

Layout:  
- Left side: Visual block (image of changemakers, action, etc.)  
- Right side: This paragraph, formatted with bullets or short lines for readability  
- Style: Same as current section layout – image + text side-by-side, vertically aligned

///////////////////////////////////////
// SECTION 3 – Our Belief (One Statement, No Header)
///////////////////////////////////////

Centered statement in bold serif or large font:

> “We believe in a future where impact matters more than money.”

Layout: centered block with whitespace around. No extra headline. Use Dopaya orange for accent underline or dots.

///////////////////////////////////////
// SECTION 4 – What We’re Trying to Build
///////////////////////////////////////

Headline: “What We’re Trying to Build”

Subheadline (styled as muted subtitle):  
> The most transparent, efficient and engaging giving platform.

Below that, show **4 icon cards** for each ecosystem pillar in horizontal row (desktop) or stacked (mobile):

1. **Transparent Giving**  
   Track every rupee, every result — live on your dashboard.

2. **Empowered Social Enterprises**  
   Fund sustainable changemakers with long-term impact.

3. **Rewarded Generosity**  
   Earn points and perks for doing good.

4. **Community-Led Movement**  
   Join a network where people drive progress together.

///////////////////////////////////////
// SECTION 5 – Comparison Table
///////////////////////////////////////


Layout: 3 or 4 simple steps, side-by-side with icons or numbers.

Title: “How Dopaya Works (For Donors)”

Steps:
   1. Pick a Project or Let Us Recommend One
Explore vetted social enterprises or get matched based on your interests.
   2. Donate with Transparency
Track your impact points and follow your contribution via your dashboard.
   3. Earn & Redeem Rewards
Unlock perks from purpose-driven brands.
   4. Repeat, Share, Rise in Ranks
Invite friends, climb levels, and grow your impact.

✅ Optional variant: Include a mini toggle above:
“[ For Donors ] [ For Brands ] [ For Social Enterprises ]”
Each shows a slightly different 3-step version. (Advanced, but great UX.)

After that the comparison table:
Keep current Dopaya vs. Traditional Sites table  
- No change to format or layout  
- You may update one label if needed (e.g., "Curated SEs" → "Vetted Changemakers")

///////////////////////////////////////
// SECTION 6 – Team (Updated Titles)
///////////////////////////////////////

Headline: “Meet the People Behind Dopaya”

Keep the card format from the screenshot  
Change **all titles to:** “Impact Partner”

If possible, allow space for a short personal quote or purpose line under each person. (e.g., “Believes in impact at scale”)

///////////////////////////////////////
// SECTION 7 – Final CTA Block
///////////////////////////////////////

Centered block with bold CTA text:

> “Want to co-build the Dopaya ecosystem with us?”

Button:  
Text: “Join the Community”  
Link: `/contact` or to your waitlist page

///////////////////////////////////////
// DESIGN NOTES
///////////////////////////////////////


//  Overall layout: Keep the current layout & Look and feel
// Fonts: Use existing typography settings from current layout.
// Section spacing: Use current padding/margins from About page.
// Responsive design: Stack sections vertically on mobile.
// Icons: Use soft flat-style illustrations for the 4 pillars (optional placeholder SVGs).
