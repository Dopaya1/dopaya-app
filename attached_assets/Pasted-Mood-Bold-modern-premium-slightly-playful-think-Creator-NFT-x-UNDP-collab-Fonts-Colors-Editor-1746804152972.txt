🔧 Shippable UI Components (Enhanced for Creators)

⸻

1. ✨ Hero Section (Full-bleed background or gradient)
	•	Headline:
“You create. You inspire. Now you can change the world.”
	•	Subheadline:
“Launch your own impact campaign. Raise funds for causes you love. Earn recognition, rewards, and a place on India’s Creator Impact Leaderboard.”
