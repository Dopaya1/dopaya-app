🎨 STYLE & LAYOUT GUIDELINES
	•	Use Dopaya’s existing brand system (fonts, orange accent color, soft beige background)
	•	Center content vertically where relevant (especially in hero/intro)
	•	Use a letter-style structure — paragraph-based, like storytelling
	•	Avoid clutter — aim for light whitespace, no harsh grid lines
	•	Icons: minimal, soft, playful (when used)
	•	Ensure mobile responsiveness


🧩 PAGE SECTIONS & CONTENT

⸻

Section 0: The name
Add the section from the current About us page, explaining the words meaning. SUe exactly the same styling


Section 1: The Why

Headline:
We believe donations should feel personal, powerful — and actually work.

Paragraphs: (Use soft serif or clean sans-serif font for storytelling tone)

We started Dopaya because we were frustrated by how broken the world of impact felt.  
Billions are donated every year, but so much of it gets lost in overhead or unclear processes.  
Meanwhile, incredible social entrepreneurs struggle to access small amounts of funding that could change lives.

What if we could make giving feel more like building something real?  
More transparent. More joyful. And more connected to outcomes — not just promises.


Section 2: What We Believe

Headline:
A better way is possible — and people-powered.

Text (short paragraphs, styled softly):
We’re building the most transparent, rewarding, and community-led giving platform.

Where every dollar is tracked. Every result is visible.  
And everyone who gives becomes part of the impact story.

Dopaya isn’t just about raising funds.  
It’s an ecosystem where generosity is rewarded, changemakers are empowered,  
and donations spark long-term impact.


Section 3: Why Dopaya Is Different

Use a 3-column layout with small icons + short text (stacked on mobile):
