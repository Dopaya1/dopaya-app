Issue Description

Navigation links are working correctly (landing at page tops)
Footer links are landing somewhere in the middle of pages instead of at the top
Project detail page links from project overview pages are not landing at page tops
Other internal links throughout the site are not consistently landing at page beginnings
Need all non-navigation links to consistently land visitors at the beginning of linked pages

Required Changes
1. Footer Links (Priority Fix)

Audit ALL footer links across every page
Remove any hash fragments or anchors causing mid-page landing
Ensure footer links use clean URLs: href="page.html" not href="page.html#section"
Test each footer link individually

2. Project Detail Page Links (Priority Fix)

Check all links from project overview/portfolio pages to individual project detail pages
Ensure these links point to clean page URLs without anchors
Verify project detail pages load from the top when accessed via these links

3. Complete Site Audit
Systematically check EVERY page for ALL internal links:

Contact page links
About page links
Service/product page links
Blog post links (if applicable)
Call-to-action buttons
Image links
Text links within content
Social media links (if internal)
Any other clickable elements that navigate to internal pages

4. Specific Areas to Check

Footer sections: Contact links, privacy policy, terms, sitemap, etc.
Project galleries: All thumbnail/title links to project details
Content areas: Any embedded links within page content
Sidebar links: If present on any pages
Button elements: Ensure all internal navigation buttons work correctly

5. Technical Check

Look for JavaScript-based navigation that might be causing scroll issues
Check for CSS that might be affecting scroll position on page load
Verify no scroll-behavior CSS is interfering with natural page loading

6. Testing Requirements

Test EVERY footer link on every page where footers appear
Test EVERY project detail link from overview pages
Test ALL internal links found during the site audit
Use browser developer tools to inspect problematic links
Clear browser cache between tests to ensure accurate results

Expected Result
ALL internal links (except navigation which already works) should bring visitors to the very beginning/top of the destination page, providing consistent user experience throughout the entire website.
