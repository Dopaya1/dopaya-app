General:
I want to build a modern web platform called Dopaya, where individual donors can support high-impact social enterprises and receive Impact Points in return and achieve certain Impact levels. Details in file attached). These points can be redeemed for rewards from consumer brands.

üéØ Website Requirements
Design Language:
    ‚Ä¢ Clean, modern, fast-loading, and mobile-first
    ‚Ä¢ Use #F55701 as the primary accent color (buttons, highlights)
    ‚Ä¢ Use #F8F6EF as the background color (light, neutral base)
    ‚Ä¢ Use bold, engaging typography
    ‚Ä¢ Avoid unnecessary animations or heavy frameworks ‚Äî keep it fast and simple
    Separate concerns cleanly: presentation logic, API calls, and business logic should not mix.
    
    Frontend (Next.js):
        Use Next.js with functional components and React hooks.
        All UI components must be defined in a /components directory.
        Each component should be reusable and accept props for dynamic rendering.
        Avoid repetition and hardcoding‚Äîabstract logic wherever possible.
        Optimize the DOM structure for minimal depth and clarity.
        Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
        Avoid heavy UI libraries.
        Ensure accessibility and mobile responsiveness.
        Use Typescript and ensure type safety.
        Proper error handling and good, meaningful error messages at every component.
        All operations must be asynchronous where appropriate (e.g., data fetching, form submissions, auth actions).
        Properly handle loading states, error handling, and async/await patterns.

    Backend (Supabase):
        Use Supabase Auth for secure, asynchronous authentication (email/password or OAuth).
        Use Supabase Database with async CRUD operations.
        Handle all database and auth interactions with async functions, with clear:
            Error messages
            Retry/fallback mechanisms where applicable
        Use Next.js API routes or Supabase client hooks to manage backend logic cleanly.
        Store secrets and API keys securely using environment variables.
