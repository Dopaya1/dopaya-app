In the FAQ page, please radd the following FAQs

Title: “Frequently Asked Questions”

// FAQ ITEMS

1. Q: Why should I donate to social enterprises instead of NGOs?  
   A: Social enterprises use sustainable business models to create long-term impact. Unlike NGOs that often rely on recurring donations, social enterprises reinvest earnings into their mission — making your donation go further. Some even deliver a measurable social return on investment (SROI) of 2×, 3× or more.

2. Q: How much does Dopaya take from donations?  
   A: Dopaya charges a small 10% fee to operate the platform and grow impact. This covers tech infrastructure, partner support, and verification. Our long-term goal is to reduce this fee even further as we scale with the help of brands and other partners.

3. Q: How does Dopaya ensure donations are used correctly?  
   A: Every social enterprise on Dopaya goes through a careful vetting process. We assess their impact model, financials, and governance to ensure credibility. We also track how funds are used and offer donors clear visibility through updates and dashboards.

4. Q: How can my social enterprise join Dopaya?  
   A: Social enterprises can apply through our simple onboarding form. We review each application carefully based on impact potential and alignment. If selected, you’ll get access to our platform and tools to grow your funding and visibility.

5. Q: How do brands collaborate with Dopaya?  
   A: Brands can offer rewards, product experiences, or exclusive perks for our donor community. They simply submit a form, and we’ll get in touch to co-create impact campaigns. It’s a unique way to connect with socially conscious, Gen Z and Millennial audiences.

6. Q: Is there any cost for brands?  
   A: No, it’s completely free. Dopaya helps purpose-driven brands reach a values-aligned audience — at no cost. You gain access to marketing exposure and impact storytelling while contributing to real change.

7. Q: Is there any cost for social enterprises?  
   A: Never. We exist to support social enterprises and help them access funding streams without lifting a finger. There are no platform fees — just more reach, more donors, and more time to focus on your mission.

8. Q: Can I choose where my donation goes?  
   A: Yes. You can explore our list of vetted social enterprises and choose who to support — or let Dopaya recommend projects based on your interests. Either way, your impact is real, transparent, and trackable.

9. Q: What kind of rewards do donors receive?  
   A: Every donation earns you Impact Points — which unlock badges, perks, and access to curated brand experiences. The more you give or refer, the more rewarding your journey becomes.

10. Q: Are donations tax-deductible?  
   A: In many cases, yes. We’re working to expand this and provide tax-friendly options for more users globally.
