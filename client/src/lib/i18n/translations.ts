          question: 'Why should I support social enterprises instead of NGOs?',
          answer: 'Social enterprises use sustainable business models to create long-term impact. Unlike NGOs that often rely on recurring donations, social enterprises reinvest earnings into their mission — making your contribution go further. Some even deliver a measurable social return on investment (SROI) of 2×, 3× or more.',

        howMuchDoesDopayaTake: {
          question: 'How much does Dopaya take from contributions?',

        },
        howDoesDopayaEnsure: {
          question: 'How does Dopaya ensure contributions are used correctly?',
          answer: 'Every social enterprise on Dopaya goes through a careful vetting process. We assess their impact model, financials, and governance to ensure credibility. We also track how funds are used and offer supporters clear visibility through updates and dashboards.',

        },
        howDoBrandsCollaborate: {
          question: 'How do brands collaborate with Dopaya?',
          answer: 'Brands can offer rewards, product experiences, or exclusive perks for our supporter community. They simply submit a form, and we\'ll get in touch to co-create impact campaigns. It\'s a unique way to connect with socially conscious, Gen Z and Millennial audiences.',

          answer: 'No, it\'s completely free. Dopaya helps purpose-driven brands reach an engaged, values-based audience — at no cost. You gain access to marketing exposure and impact storytelling while contributing to real change.\n\nImportant: Participation is currently free — and for the first brands in our community, it will remain free permanently.',
        },
        isThereCostForSocialEnterprises: {
          question: 'Is there any cost for social enterprises?',

        canIChooseContribution: {
          question: 'Can I choose where my contribution goes?',
          answer: 'Yes. You can explore our list of vetted social enterprises and choose who to support — or let Dopaya recommend an initiative based on your interests. Either way, your impact is real, transparent, and trackable.',
        },
        whatKindOfRewards: {
          question: 'What kind of rewards do supporters receive?',
          answer: 'Every contribution earns you Impact Points — which unlock badges, perks, and access to curated brand experiences. The more you give or refer, the more rewarding your journey becomes.',
        },
        areContributionsTaxDeductible: {
          question: 'Are contributions tax-deductible?',
          answer: 'In many cases, contributions can be tax-advantaged – however, this depends on local regulations and your country of residence.\n\nWe\'re working to offer more tax-friendly options for our users in the future.',

      faq1Question: 'How does Dopaya make money if you don\'t charge SEs?',
      faq1Answer: 'We operate on optional platform tips from supporters and brand partnerships. SEs keep 100% of supporter funding. Our revenue comes from supporters who choose to tip us (like supporting Dopaya as a social enterprise too) and brands who pay for access to our engaged community.',
      faq2Question: 'What\'s the application and onboarding process like?',
      faq2Answer: 'Simple application form, impact verification call, and onboarding. Typically 1-2 weeks from application to going live. We handle most of the setup - you just need to provide basic information about your impact and business model.',
      faq3Question: 'How much time do I need to commit monthly?',
      faq3Answer: 'Minimal - just monthly impact updates (5 min) and quarterly check-ins (15 min). We handle the rest including supporter communication, platform management, and impact tracking.',
      faq4Question: 'What if my SE doesn\'t fit traditional funding models?',
      faq4Answer: 'Perfect! That\'s exactly who we\'re looking for. We understand sustainable business models that create impact. If you\'re "too social for investors, not understood by banks, too business for grant makers" - you\'re our ideal partner.',
      faq5Question: 'How is this different from GoFundMe or Patreon?',

            question: 'Why should I support social enterprises instead of NGOs?',
            answer: 'Social enterprises use sustainable business models to create long-term impact. Unlike NGOs that often rely on recurring donations, social enterprises reinvest earnings into their mission — so your contribution moves even more in the long term! Some social enterprises even deliver a measurable social return on investment (SROI) of 2×, 3× or more.',

            question: 'How does Dopaya make money?',

          {
            question: 'How does Dopaya ensure contributions are used correctly?',

          {
            question: 'Can I choose where my contribution goes?',
